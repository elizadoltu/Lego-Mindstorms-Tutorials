# Lego-Mindstorms-Tutorials
# Tutorials for all the robots available in the Lego Mindstorms Robot Inventor in order to understand better the syntaxes and the logic behind.

# Even though in the application LEGO MINDSTORMS you have all the documentation for the python syntax, what I want to achieve is to help you to make from the simple programs up to the complex ones and to explain them.
